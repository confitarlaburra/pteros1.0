#Installation

You need to have the pteros library installed:

http://pteros.sourceforge.net/

to compile:

add in Makefile:

g++  program/your_program -I/home/jgarate/opt/pteros/include -L/home/jgarate/opt/pteros/lib/ -lpteros -lpteros_analysis -ltng_io -std=c++11 -o outname

% make

#Programs:
Length units are in nanometers!!!

MSDcyl_SRV_DSTY: Computes MSD,survival probability of selection within a cylinder aligned in z.

% MSDcyl_SRV_DSTY -f ../ref.pdb ../traj_1.dcd ... -b 0fr -e 10000fr -sel "sel" -min_z -1.2 -max_z 1.2 -rad 0.4  -win 1000 -ref_sel "ref sel" -dim z 

-f       = reference pdb and trajectories 
-b       = inital frame
-e       = final frame
-sel     = selected atoms for MSD, survival prob and density
-min_z   = min z coor of cylinder
-max_z   = max z coor of cylinder
-rad     = radius of cylinder
-win     = windows employed for calculation
-ref_sel = reference selection for fitting
-dim     = dimensions to be considered for msd, e.g. z or z y or z y x  (in any order)

It is advisable to wrap trajectories centered along the cylinder:
in vvmd for a dcd:
%pbc wrap -center com -centersel "resname CNT" -all



MSDsph_SRV_DSTY: Computes MSD,survival probability of selection within a sphere centered in 0.0.0

% MSDcyl_SRV_DSTY -f ../ref.pdb ../traj_1.dcd ... -b 0fr -e 10000fr -sel "sel" -min_z -1.2 -max_z 1.2 -rad 0.4  -win 1000 -ref_sel "ref sel" -dim z 

-f       = reference pdb and trajectories 
-b       = inital frame
-e       = final frame
-sel     = selected atoms for MSD, survival prob and density
-rad     = radius of sphere
-win     = windows employed for calculation
-ref_sel = reference selection for fitting
-dim     = dimensions to be considered for msd, e.g. z or z y or z y x  (in any order)

It is advisable to wrap trajectories centered along the sphere:
in vvmd for a dcd:
%pbc wrap -center com -centersel "resname CNT" -all


MSDbox_DSTY: Computes MSD for particles in a box

% MSDbox_DSTY -f ../ref.pdb ../traj_1.dcd ... -b 0fr -e 10000fr -sel "name OH2" -win 60  -dim  z y x -box 2.28 2.28 2.28

-f       = reference pdb and trajectories 
-b       = inital frame
-e       = final frame
-sel     = selected atoms for MSD, survival prob and density
-win     = windows employed for calculation
-dim     = dimensions to be considered for msd, e.g. z or z y or z y x  (in any order)
-box     = orthorombic box dimensions in x,y and z (in this order!!!) , system must be centered at origin.

It is advisable to unwrap trajectories previous to run this program
in vmd for a dcd:
%pbc unwrap -all
